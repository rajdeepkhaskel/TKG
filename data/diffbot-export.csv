Russia-Ukraine war: Putin accuses Kyiv of trying to intimidate civilians with Moscow drone attack – as it happened,d2023-05-30T17:47:04,Helen Sullivan,https://static.guim.co.uk/images/favicon-32x32.ico,the Guardian,"Vladimir Putin,President of Russia,Kyiv,Russo-Ukrainian War,Moscow,Russia,drone attack,civilian,Ukraine","Russian president Vladimir Putin has accused Ukraine of terrorist activity and claimed Kyiv has chosen the path of intimidation of Russian citizens.
He said that the drone attack on Moscow earlier on Tuesday was aimed at “civilian targets” and that the capital’s air defences would be boosted. He said that they had worked satisfactorily but “there was something to work on”.
He said that Ukraine had chosen the path of attempting “to intimidate Russia, Russian citizens [with] attacks on residential buildings” and added that the drone attacks were “clearly a sign of terrorist activity.”
The president, who ordered a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February last year, in comments carried by Tass, also threatened retaliation, saying residents of Ukraine should understand that the leadership of their country is pushing Russia to respond.
He said it was not Russia that unleashed the war, again blaming Nato expansion.
He stated that competition between the Russian Federation and Ukraine after the collapse of the Soviet Union was inevitable, but it was assumed that it would go in a civilized way.
However, he asserted that Ukraine was then controlled by people who embarked on the path of creating anti-Russian sentiment at the suggestion of the west, and that Russia was deceived when they promised not to expand Nato to the east, and then they even got to Ukraine, which was promised eventual Nato membership.",-0.757,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/may/30/russia-ukraine-war-live-house-on-fire-in-kyiv-as-capital-comes-under-third-attack-in-24-hours?filterKeyEvents=false&page=with%3Ablock-647635cf8f0867f6fdd213a8
